you see something amazing in the first five seconds. a beautiful object. a
swirling particle system. or a character. when you realize that the game is
waiting for your input, and you press a direction, you "wake up." maybe you

the object/person to scatter to 4 pieces, going up/down/left/right. the ground
and sky are mysteries in terms of how to get there.
