# some compile-time questions

[meta] first, see if they are answered in the howtos. there definitely already are some compile time howtos! then, if they aren't propose them in `#questions` on discord.

1. can we get a general mental-model-dump howto of how the compiler's dependency tracking works? how placeholders get filled?
2. some functions could use documentation. what happens if you call Compiler.get_type_table inside an `#insert #run`? does it "wait" for the type table to be filled?
