# how to avoid the unity play mode/edit mode dichotomy?

## first - play mode / edit mode is USEFUL 
It lets you try out changes, and then revert them, or keep them so we don't want to lose that, at least.

*BUT.* the thing we want *in addition* is to quickly move between play and edit...without breaking flow. In the platformer, being able to jump around, see a problem, and fix it, or add a new thing, and then go back to playing the level, all without losing context. THAT sounds like something worth trying to do.

Maybe the whole idea of separating edit and play mode is holding us back.
