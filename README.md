# jaicc

Originally from Jai's `examples/` directory.

Updated with more options for modifying binding names.

    // jai c compiler/converter
    // Converts C code into Jai code.
    // Usage: jaicc [options] <inputs>
    // [options] can be any of Clang's supported flags (see: jaicc -help for details)
    // Will primarily be useful for generating bindings to pre-existing C libraries
